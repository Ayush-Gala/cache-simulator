# cache-simulator
This project explores cache coherence protocols in parallel architectures by simulating a 4-processor system. The simulator is designed to evaluate and compare the MESI and MOESI coherence protocols. The implementation tracks key statistics such as cache hits, misses, memory transactions, and coherence signals.
